MineStock
=========
MineStock is a small project I've decided to undertake to model the stock market in the digital world. While stocks are sort of an abstract thing to add to a game world, the plugin was designed more for a 'Because I can' rather than 'this would be a cool feature'. However, given the interest I've received for this project, it has the potential to be quite successful on servers with a well-established economy and many players.

With that in mind, this plugin is meant to be used for fun. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT COMES FROM USING THIS PLUGIN. By using this plugin, you accept the losses incurred from its use and misuse. 

With that said, you're literally playing a stock market. Ingame losses are to be expected. While I intend to make this plugin as crash-less as possible, your being stupid is not my (or my code's) fault. Be sensible with your money.
