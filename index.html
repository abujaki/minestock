<p>MineStock is a small project I've decided to undertake to model the stock market in the digital world. While stocks are sort of an abstract thing to add to a game world, the plugin was designed more for a 'Because I can' rather than 'this would be a cool feature'. However, given the interest I've received for this project, it has the potential to be quite successful on servers with a well-established economy and many players.</p>

<p>With that in mind, this plugin is meant to be used for fun. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT COMES FROM USING THIS PLUGIN. By using this plugin, you accept the losses incurred from its use and misuse. </p>

<p>With that said, you're literally playing a stock market. Ingame losses are to be expected. While I intend to make this plugin as crash-less as possible, your being stupid is not my (or my code's) fault. Be sensible with your money.</p>
