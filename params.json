{"name":"Minestock","tagline":"Stock market Bukkit plugin","body":"MineStock\r\n=========\r\nMineStock is a small project I've decided to undertake to model the stock market in the digital world. While stocks are sort of an abstract thing to add to a game world, the plugin was designed more for a 'Because I can' rather than 'this would be a cool feature'. However, given the interest I've received for this project, it has the potential to be quite successful on servers with a well-established economy and many players.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, this plugin is meant to be used for fun. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT COMES FROM USING THIS PLUGIN. By using this plugin, you accept the losses incurred from its use and misuse. \r\n\r\nWith that said, you're literally playing a stock market. Ingame losses are to be expected. While I intend to make this plugin as crash-less as possible, your being stupid is not my (or my code's) fault. Be sensible with your money.\r\n\r\nThe project page can be found at https://github.com/abujaki21/minestock\r\n\r\nVersion\r\n-------\r\n* 0.1.0 Stable/Unfunctional\r\nAdded\r\n+ Basic bukkit Framework\r\n+ Vault Hooks for Permissions and Economy\r\n+ Plugin loads with Bukkit\r\n+ stockbuy and stocksell commands (See \"/help minestock\" for their uses)\r\n+ Made a valiant effort at dummy-profing the commands\r\n+ Returns semi-helpful error messages\r\nKnown Issues\r\n! Vault chat hooks do not yet work properly\r\n! The plugin is still quite non-functional\r\n\r\nFor past versions, consult the changelog\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n* The latest version of Bukkit running on your minecraft server, found at http://bukkit.org\r\n\tLast tested with Bukkit Dev Build 1.6.4-R0.1\r\n* The latest version of Vault, downloadable at http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/\r\n\tLast tested with Vault 1.2.27 for CB 1.6.2-R0.1\r\n* a vault-compatible permissions and economy system\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nDrag and Drop the MineStock.jar file into your bukkit plugins folder, then Restart your server.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\nQ: Why?\r\n\r\nA: Why not?\r\n\r\nA: I was bored.\r\n\r\nA: FOR SCIENCE!\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\nmyself (so far)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
